Two types of objects were produced:

    # object "*_rcg_all" includes all hauls, etc of trips that registered >=1 haul in RCG areas [i.e., may be pan-regional]
    # object "*_rcg" includes only data and samples from hauls RCG area
        # example:
              # take a long trip that fished in BA and NSEA...
                # all its data and bio samples will be in "*_rcg_all". trip data will be similar in files for RCG_BA and RCG_NSEA
                # only the data from hauls in BA will be in "*_rcg" (RCG_BA), only the data from hauls in NA will be in "*_rcg" (RCG_NA). If you merge the two you get the full trip present in "*_rcg_all".
