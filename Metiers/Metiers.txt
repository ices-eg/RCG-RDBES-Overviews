A GitHub repository for managing and documenting the metier assignment to transversal data.
Made by the Intersessional Sub-Group on Metier Issues 2019

ToR 1: To facilitate harmonization of métier assignment, set up and manage a public repository 
for storing reference lists, documentation of procedures, scripts related to assigning métiers 
to transversal data as well as métier descriptions. 
Make sure that it is possible to link this platform with a future website.

ToR 2: Initiate and collect documentation of logic applied by MS to assign métiers
ToR 3: Make metier descriptions based on template.
ToR 4: Agree on a reference list of species grouped into species groups.
ToR 5: Clean up the metier lists. Remove overlapping metiers and standardize the codes.
ToR 6: Make a script for a standard procedure for assigning metiers based on a common data format, taking into account the recommendations made at the Metier workshop.
